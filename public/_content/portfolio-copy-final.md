## Bio

Most of the information that shapes people's lives — housing law, zoning codes, court procedures — is written to be unreadable. That's not an accident. My work makes it legible.

I'm a multimedia journalist and designer who translates complex systems into clear visual stories and functional tools. I spent over a decade in production at New York agencies, managing large-scale rollouts for clients like Spotify and Microsoft — hundreds of assets, multiple languages, zero margin for error.

Now I apply that same rigor to housing justice. I build digital tools and visual investigations that help homeowners, organizers, and advocates understand and fight back against deed theft, displacement, and bureaucratic abuse in Brooklyn.

## Work

### Stop Deed Theft vs. 79th Precinct: The Charrington Case
Visual Investigation — Instagram Carousel / @stopdeedtheft

A homeowner's case was being buried through institutional denial — police refusing to file reports, officials ignoring Supreme Court orders. The abuse was invisible because it was hidden behind badges and procedural language.

A multi-slide visual essay juxtaposing legal documents against on-the-ground footage of the home invasion, stripping anonymity from the actors involved and making the paper trail publicly readable.

34,600+ reach, 31,000+ views. Turned a case the system was suppressing into a public record that created accountability pressure.

### 168 Patchen Avenue: The Florence Case
Visual Investigation — Video / @stopdeedtheft

A Bed-Stuy homeowner's property was taken through mortgage fraud. The family contacted every level of enforcement — the DA, the Attorney General, the Governor's office, NYPD's 81st Precinct — and got nothing. Meanwhile, the property was being destroyed from the inside.

A two-minute vertical video builds the case visually — opening with photos of the home before the damage, then cutting to November 2025 footage of the gutted interior, exposed electrical systems, and unauthorized occupants. The officials who were contacted — DA, AG, Governor, presiding judge — are composited as a persistent layer over the footage, so the viewer watches the destruction unfold with the faces of the people who allowed it locked on screen. The inaction and the consequences are never separated.

Documented an active case of institutional failure in real time, creating a public evidence trail for the homeowner's advocates. Ends with a direct call to action and contact number for other mortgage fraud victims — turning a single case into an intake channel for a broader pattern.

### One-Tap Mobilizer
Web Application — Built for Dr. June's Campaign

Filing a complaint against an inactive elected official requires researching the right agencies, finding contact information, and drafting legally specific language. Most supporters never get past step one.

A React-based tool that automates the entire chain — pre-loaded with direct contacts at the Queens DA's office and relevant oversight bodies, formatted with legally specific demands.

Reduced the time from intent to action from roughly 20 minutes to under 10 seconds. Enabled supporters with no legal background to send correctly formatted complaints at scale.

## Background

Technical lead for global production rollouts (Spotify, Microsoft). Managed 400+ assets across 10+ languages with zero-error delivery standards. The discipline required to ship at that scale — version control, cross-platform QA, stakeholder coordination — is the same discipline I bring to investigative and advocacy work. The difference is the client.
