                Most of the information that shapes people's lives — housing law, zoning codes, court procedures — is written to be unreadable. That's not an accident. My work makes it legible.

                I'm a multimedia journalist and designer who translates complex systems into clear visual stories and functional tools. I spent over a decade as technical lead on global production rollouts for Spotify and Microsoft — managing 400+ assets across 10+ languages with zero-error delivery standards. That discipline is the same discipline I bring to investigative and advocacy work.
