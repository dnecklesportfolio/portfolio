                Most of the information that shapes people's lives — housing law, zoning codes, court procedures — is written to be unreadable. That's not an accident. My work makes it legible.

                I'm a multimedia journalist and designer who translates complex systems into clear visual stories and functional tools. I spent over a decade in production at New York agencies, managing large-scale rollouts for clients like Spotify and Microsoft — hundreds of assets, multiple languages, zero margin for error.

                Now I apply that same rigor to housing justice. I build digital tools and visual investigations that help homeowners, organizers, and advocates understand and fight back against deed theft, displacement, and bureaucratic abuse in Brooklyn.
